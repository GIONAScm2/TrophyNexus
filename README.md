## Features

TrophyNexus will eventually match all the features of my prior userscripts ([PSNPlatinum](https://github.com/GIONAScm2/PSNPlatinum) and [TA-Trophies](https://github.com/GIONAScm2/TA-Trophies)), but for now, the following features are available:

### General:

- Adds 'Series' tab to top nav menu
- Floating "‚öôÔ∏è" context menu to access settings/preferences:
  - `General` settings, like disabling default features or enabling opt-in features
  - `Platify` settings that make the site more platinum-oriented if you'd rather pretend DLC and nonplats don't exist
  - `Flagged` settings (only visible to flagged users) that can hide the red panel from your profile and (coming soon) inject you into the 100% Club (First/Fastest)

### Series Catalog *('Series' tab)*
- By default, the catalog is replaced with a custom table
  - Bidirectional sorting by 24+ dimensions/metrics
  - Multi-filtering
  - Search bar

### Forum
- Adds "üèÜ" shortcut button to game topics to quickly navigate to corresponding trophy list
